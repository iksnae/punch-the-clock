A task-based time tracking CLI tool designed for developers and AI coding agents to measure development velocity.

## Overview

PTC (Punch the Clock) allows you to create projects, attach tasks with numbers, titles, descriptions, states, and tags, then track time using simple start/pause/resume/stop commands. All time calculations are based on timestamps - no actual timers required. Perfect for measuring development velocity and estimation accuracy.

## üì¶ Available on npm

PTC is now available as a global npm package! Install it once and use the `ptc` command from anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g punch-the-clock
ptc --help
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.0.0 or higher (for npm installation)
- MySQL 8.0 or higher (local or remote)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new project
ptc init my-project

# Add a task with optional estimates
ptc add "Fix login bug" --estimate 2h --size 3

# Start tracking time
ptc start 1

# Pause, resume, or stop
ptc pause
ptc resume
ptc stop

# Generate velocity reports
ptc report velocity
ptc report estimates
```

## Commands

### Project Management
```bash
ptc init <project-name>          # Create a new project
ptc list projects                # List all projects
ptc project <project-name>       # Switch to a project
```

### Task Management
```bash
ptc add <title>                  # Add a new task
ptc list tasks                   # List tasks in current project
ptc task <task-id>               # Show task details
ptc update <task-id>             # Update task properties
```

### Time Tracking
```bash
ptc start <task-id>              # Start time tracking
ptc pause                        # Pause current tracking
ptc resume                       # Resume paused tracking
ptc stop                         # Stop time tracking
```

### Reporting
```bash
ptc report time                  # Show time tracking reports
ptc report velocity              # Show velocity metrics
ptc report estimates             # Show estimation accuracy
```

### Configuration
```bash
ptc config show                  # Show current configuration
ptc config set <key> <value>     # Set configuration value
```

## Database Setup

PTC will automatically create the database schema on first run. You can also set it up manually:

```bash
# Create database
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE ptc;"

# Set up user (optional)
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE USER 'ptc'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';"
mysql -u root -p -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ptc.* TO 'ptc'@'localhost';"
```

## Configuration

Create a `.ptcrc` file in your home directory:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "user": "ptc",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "ptc"
  }
}
```
