# Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratified:** 2024-12-19  
**Last Amended:** 2024-12-19

## Project Identity

**Name:** Punch  
**Purpose:** A task-based time tracking CLI that provides simple, intuitive project and task management with timestamp-based time calculations  
**Domain:** Developer productivity tools, time tracking, project management

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First

All interfaces MUST be simple, intuitive, and fast. Complex operations MUST be broken down into simple, composable commands. The CLI MUST provide immediate feedback and clear error messages.

**Rationale:** Time tracking tools are used frequently throughout the day. Complexity creates friction and reduces adoption. Simple interfaces reduce cognitive load and increase productivity.

### Data Integrity

All time calculations MUST be based on precise timestamps. The system MUST maintain data consistency and provide reliable backup/recovery mechanisms. Database schema MUST be versioned and migratable.

**Rationale:** Time tracking data is critical for billing, reporting, and productivity analysis. Data loss or corruption is unacceptable. Timestamp-based calculations ensure accuracy and auditability.

### Performance Excellence

The CLI MUST respond to commands within 100ms for typical operations. Database queries MUST be optimized for common use cases. The system MUST handle thousands of tasks and projects without degradation.

**Rationale:** Developers expect instant feedback from CLI tools. Slow responses break workflow and reduce tool adoption. Performance is a competitive advantage in developer tools.

### Extensibility

The system MUST support custom tags, flexible project hierarchies, and configurable reporting. The architecture MUST allow for future features without breaking existing functionality.

**Rationale:** Different teams have different workflows and reporting needs. A rigid system becomes obsolete quickly. Extensibility ensures long-term viability and user satisfaction.

### Reliability

The system MUST handle network failures, database unavailability, and concurrent access gracefully. All operations MUST be atomic and provide clear error recovery paths.

**Rationale:** Time tracking is mission-critical for many users. System failures during time tracking can result in lost billable hours or productivity data. Reliability builds trust and ensures user retention.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

Constitution amendments require:

1. Documented rationale for change
2. Impact assessment on dependent templates
3. Version increment following semantic versioning
4. Update of all dependent artifacts

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions
- **MINOR**: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance  
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

All project artifacts MUST align with constitution principles. Regular reviews ensure consistency across:

- Technical specifications
- Implementation plans
- Task categorization
- Command templates
- Documentation

## Implementation Standards

### Code Quality

- All code MUST pass linting and type checking
- Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds
- Documentation MUST be current and accurate

### Database Design

- Schema MUST be versioned and migratable
- Data integrity constraints MUST be enforced
- Backup and recovery procedures MUST be documented

### User Experience

- Interface MUST be intuitive and fast
- Error messages MUST be clear and actionable
- Performance MUST meet specified benchmarks

### Security

- Sensitive data MUST be properly encrypted
- Access controls MUST be implemented
- Audit trails MUST be maintained

## Compliance Verification

This constitution serves as the authoritative source for all project decisions. Any deviation requires explicit justification and potential amendment to this document.
