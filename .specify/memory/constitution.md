# Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Ratified:** 2024-12-19  
**Last Amended:** 2024-12-19

## Project Identity

**Name:** Punch  
**Purpose:** A task-based time tracking CLI designed for developers and AI coding agents to track development velocity through precise time measurement and estimation comparison  
**Domain:** Developer productivity tools, time tracking, project management, development velocity analytics

## Target Audience

**Primary Users:** Developers and AI coding agents who need to track development velocity and productivity metrics.

**Use Cases:**

- Individual developer time tracking and productivity analysis
- Team velocity measurement and sprint planning
- AI agent performance monitoring and optimization
- Estimation accuracy analysis through retrospective comparison
- Development workflow optimization and bottleneck identification

## Velocity Tracking Capabilities

The system MUST support development velocity measurement through:

### Estimation Tracking

- Tasks MUST support optional size estimates (story points, complexity units)
- Tasks MUST support optional time estimates (hours, days)
- Estimates MUST be captured at task creation or modification
- Historical estimate changes MUST be tracked for analysis

### Actual vs. Estimated Analysis

- The system MUST calculate estimation accuracy metrics
- Reports MUST show variance between estimated and actual time
- Velocity trends MUST be trackable over time periods
- Burndown and burnup charts MUST be supported

### Developer Productivity Metrics

- Individual developer velocity MUST be measurable
- Team velocity aggregation MUST be supported
- Task completion rates MUST be trackable
- Context switching and interruption analysis MUST be available

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First

All interfaces MUST be simple, intuitive, and fast. Complex operations MUST be broken down into simple, composable commands. The CLI MUST provide immediate feedback and clear error messages.

**Rationale:** Time tracking tools are used frequently throughout the day. Complexity creates friction and reduces adoption. Simple interfaces reduce cognitive load and increase productivity.

### Data Integrity

All time calculations MUST be based on precise timestamps. The system MUST maintain data consistency and provide reliable backup/recovery mechanisms. Database schema MUST be versioned and migratable. Estimation data MUST be preserved with full audit trails for velocity analysis.

**Rationale:** Time tracking and velocity data is critical for development planning, productivity analysis, and estimation accuracy. Data loss or corruption is unacceptable. Timestamp-based calculations and preserved estimation history ensure accuracy and enable meaningful velocity analytics.

### Performance Excellence

The CLI MUST respond to commands within 100ms for typical operations. Database queries MUST be optimized for common use cases. The system MUST handle thousands of tasks and projects without degradation.

**Rationale:** Developers expect instant feedback from CLI tools. Slow responses break workflow and reduce tool adoption. Performance is a competitive advantage in developer tools.

### Extensibility

The system MUST support custom tags, flexible project hierarchies, configurable reporting, and extensible velocity metrics. The architecture MUST allow for future features without breaking existing functionality. Custom estimation units and velocity calculation methods MUST be configurable.

**Rationale:** Different development teams have different workflows, estimation practices, and reporting needs. A rigid system becomes obsolete quickly. Extensibility ensures long-term viability and supports diverse development methodologies and team structures.

### Reliability

The system MUST handle network failures, database unavailability, and concurrent access gracefully. All operations MUST be atomic and provide clear error recovery paths.

**Rationale:** Time tracking is mission-critical for many users. System failures during time tracking can result in lost billable hours or productivity data. Reliability builds trust and ensures user retention.

### Velocity Analytics

The system MUST provide comprehensive velocity analytics including estimation accuracy, trend analysis, and productivity metrics. All velocity calculations MUST be transparent and auditable. Historical data MUST be preserved for long-term trend analysis.

**Rationale:** Development velocity tracking is essential for project planning, team performance optimization, and continuous improvement. Accurate velocity analytics enable better estimation practices and help identify productivity bottlenecks and improvement opportunities.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

Constitution amendments require:

1. Documented rationale for change
2. Impact assessment on dependent templates
3. Version increment following semantic versioning
4. Update of all dependent artifacts

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions
- **MINOR**: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance  
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

All project artifacts MUST align with constitution principles. Regular reviews ensure consistency across:

- Technical specifications
- Implementation plans
- Task categorization
- Command templates
- Documentation

## Implementation Standards

### Code Quality

- All code MUST pass linting and type checking
- Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds
- Documentation MUST be current and accurate

### Database Design

- Schema MUST be versioned and migratable
- Data integrity constraints MUST be enforced
- Backup and recovery procedures MUST be documented
- Estimation history MUST be preserved with timestamps
- Velocity calculation tables MUST be optimized for analytics queries

### User Experience

- Interface MUST be intuitive and fast
- Error messages MUST be clear and actionable
- Performance MUST meet specified benchmarks
- Velocity reports MUST be easily accessible and understandable
- Estimation workflows MUST be streamlined for developer productivity

### Security

- Sensitive data MUST be properly encrypted
- Access controls MUST be implemented
- Audit trails MUST be maintained

## Compliance Verification

This constitution serves as the authoritative source for all project decisions. Any deviation requires explicit justification and potential amendment to this document.
