# PTC MVP Feature Specification

## Feature Overview

**Feature Name:** PTC MVP - Core Time Tracking CLI  
**Priority:** High  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Target Audience:** Developers and AI coding agents

## User Stories

### Core Time Tracking
- As a developer, I want to create projects so I can organize my work
- As a developer, I want to add tasks to projects with metadata so I can track specific work items
- As a developer, I want to start/pause/resume/stop time tracking so I can measure actual time spent
- As a developer, I want to see time reports so I can analyze my productivity

### Velocity Tracking
- As a developer, I want to add size estimates to tasks so I can track velocity
- As a developer, I want to add time estimates to tasks so I can compare with actual time
- As a developer, I want to see estimation accuracy reports so I can improve my estimates
- As a developer, I want to see velocity trends so I can understand my productivity patterns

### AI Agent Support
- As an AI coding agent, I want to programmatically track time so I can report on task completion
- As an AI coding agent, I want to log task metadata so I can provide detailed reports

## Functional Requirements

### Project Management
- Create, list, and manage projects
- Project metadata: name, description, created date
- Project hierarchy support for future extensibility

### Task Management
- Create tasks with: number, title, description, state, tags
- Optional size estimates (story points, complexity units)
- Optional time estimates (hours, days)
- Task states: pending, in-progress, completed, blocked
- Tag system for categorization

### Time Tracking
- Start time tracking for a task
- Pause/resume time tracking
- Stop time tracking
- Timestamp-based calculations (no actual timers)
- Support for multiple concurrent tasks (pause one, start another)

### Database
- MySQL database for persistence
- Schema versioning and migrations
- Data integrity constraints
- Backup and recovery support

### Reporting
- Time spent by task, project, tags
- Velocity reports (story points per time period)
- Estimation accuracy reports
- Basic trend analysis

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- CLI commands respond within 100ms
- Database queries optimized for common operations
- Support for thousands of tasks and projects

### Reliability
- Graceful handling of database unavailability
- Atomic operations for data consistency
- Clear error messages and recovery paths

### Usability
- Simple, intuitive CLI interface
- Clear command structure and help
- Immediate feedback for all operations

### Extensibility
- Modular architecture for future features
- Configurable estimation units
- Extensible reporting system

## Technical Constraints

- Node.js runtime (>=16.0.0)
- MySQL database
- TypeScript for type safety
- Command-line interface only (no GUI)

## Success Criteria

1. **Core Functionality**: Users can create projects, add tasks, and track time
2. **Velocity Tracking**: Users can add estimates and see accuracy reports
3. **Performance**: All commands respond within 100ms
4. **Data Integrity**: No data loss during normal operations
5. **Usability**: New users can start tracking time within 5 minutes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Project Management
- [ ] `ptc init <project-name>` creates a new project
- [ ] `ptc list projects` shows all projects
- [ ] `ptc project <name>` switches to a project context

### Task Management
- [ ] `ptc add <title>` creates a new task
- [ ] `ptc add <title> --estimate 2h --size 3` creates task with estimates
- [ ] `ptc list tasks` shows all tasks in current project
- [ ] `ptc task <id>` shows task details

### Time Tracking
- [ ] `ptc start <task-id>` begins time tracking
- [ ] `ptc pause` pauses current time tracking
- [ ] `ptc resume` resumes paused time tracking
- [ ] `ptc stop` stops time tracking and saves session

### Reporting
- [ ] `ptc report time` shows time spent by task/project
- [ ] `ptc report velocity` shows velocity metrics
- [ ] `ptc report estimates` shows estimation accuracy

### Database
- [ ] Database schema created automatically on first run
- [ ] All operations are atomic and consistent
- [ ] Data persists across CLI sessions

## Dependencies

- MySQL server (local or remote)
- Node.js runtime
- npm packages: commander, mysql2, chalk, inquirer, ora, table, date-fns

## Risks

### High Risk
- Database connection failures during time tracking
- Data corruption during concurrent operations
- Performance degradation with large datasets

### Medium Risk
- Complex estimation calculations
- Time zone handling for distributed teams
- CLI interface complexity

## Mitigation Strategies

- Implement robust error handling and recovery
- Use database transactions for atomic operations
- Optimize queries and implement pagination
- Keep CLI interface simple and focused
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
