# PTC MVP Implementation Plan

## Constitution Check
This plan MUST align with the project constitution principles:
- [x] Simplicity First compliance verified - Simple CLI commands, immediate feedback
- [x] Data Integrity compliance verified - Timestamp-based calculations, MySQL with transactions
- [x] Performance Excellence compliance verified - <100ms response time, optimized queries
- [x] Extensibility compliance verified - Modular architecture, configurable estimation units
- [x] Reliability compliance verified - Atomic operations, graceful error handling
- [x] Velocity Analytics compliance verified - Estimation tracking, accuracy reports

## Project Overview
**Name:** PTC MVP - Core Time Tracking CLI  
**Objective:** Deliver a functional time tracking CLI that enables developers and AI agents to track development velocity through precise time measurement and estimation comparison  
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks

## Scope Definition
### In Scope
- Core CLI interface with project and task management
- Time tracking with start/pause/resume/stop functionality
- MySQL database integration with schema management
- Basic estimation tracking (size and time estimates)
- Essential reporting (time, velocity, estimation accuracy)
- Error handling and data integrity
- Package distribution via npm

### Out of Scope
- Web interface or GUI
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics and dashboards
- Integration with external tools (Jira, GitHub, etc.)
- Mobile applications
- Real-time notifications

## Technical Architecture
### Core Components
- CLI Interface Layer (Commander.js for command parsing)
- Business Logic Layer (Project, Task, TimeTracking services)
- Data Access Layer (MySQL database with connection pooling)
- Reporting Engine (Time calculations, velocity metrics)
- Configuration Management (Database setup, user preferences)

### Technology Stack
- Node.js (>=16.0.0) with TypeScript
- MySQL 8.0+ for data persistence
- Commander.js for CLI interface
- mysql2 for database connectivity
- Chalk for colored output
- Inquirer for interactive prompts
- Ora for loading indicators
- Table for formatted output
- date-fns for date/time manipulation

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Foundation & Core CLI (Weeks 1-2)
- Project setup with TypeScript and build configuration
- MySQL database schema design and migration system
- Basic CLI structure with Commander.js
- Project management commands (init, list, switch)
- Task management commands (add, list, show)
- Database connection and basic CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Time Tracking & Reporting (Weeks 3-4)
- Time tracking commands (start, pause, resume, stop)
- Timestamp-based time calculations
- Basic reporting (time spent by task/project)
- Error handling and data validation
- CLI help and user guidance

### Phase 3: Velocity Tracking & Polish (Weeks 5-6)
- Estimation tracking (size and time estimates)
- Velocity reporting and estimation accuracy
- Performance optimization and testing
- Package preparation and npm publishing
- Documentation and user guides

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk
- Database connection failures during time tracking operations
- Data corruption from concurrent CLI sessions
- Performance degradation with large datasets (1000+ tasks)

### Medium Risk
- Complex time calculation edge cases (timezone, daylight saving)
- MySQL setup complexity for end users
- CLI interface becoming too complex for simple use cases

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement robust connection pooling and retry logic
- Use database transactions for all time tracking operations
- Add comprehensive error handling with clear recovery instructions
- Optimize database queries and implement pagination
- Keep CLI interface simple with progressive disclosure
- Provide Docker setup option for easy MySQL deployment
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging

## Success Criteria
- Users can create projects and track time within 5 minutes of installation
- All CLI commands respond within 100ms for typical operations
- Time tracking data is never lost due to system failures
- Estimation accuracy reports provide actionable insights
- Package successfully publishes to npm and installs globally
